<Accordion title="Why does Next.js use 307 and 308?">
  Traditionally a 302 was used for a temporary redirect, and a 301 for a
  permanent redirect, but many browsers changed the request method of the
  redirect to `GET`, regardless of the original method. For example, if the
  browser made a request to `POST /v1/users` which returned status code `302`
  with location `/v2/users`, the subsequent request might be `GET /v2/users`
  instead of the expected `POST /v2/users`. Next.js uses the 307 temporary
  redirect, and 308 permanent redirect status codes to explicitly preserve the
  request method used.

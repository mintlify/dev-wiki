At Mintlify, we create public-facing documentation for other companies.
If you're a company that needs help guides, tutorials, or API references, you can use Mintlify to write,
edit, and maintain the content, customize the look and feel, and host your docs.
We are an all-in-one platform or a one-stop-shop to fulfill all of your documentation needs.

## Mission

Prior to the 2010s, developer content was essentially a commodity. Everything was either in PDFs or crappy plaintext static pages.
In the 2010s, companies like Stripe, Hashicorp, Twilio, and a bunch others raised the bar on developer content.
They proved that a truly great developer experience for their content is not just a commodity, but a competitive advantage.
Since then, every company has been trying to catch up, but it's actually quite difficult.
That's why we exist today. We help companies meet that bar.

In the 2020s, the bar is rising once again, but this time, it's not just with the UI, but the way developers and editors are fundamentally interacting with the content because of AI.
Docs need to have an AI chat to answer questions directly. And it will go much deeper into that.

- Content creation will also change. AI assistance will help companies write technical content, automatically based on product changes and user feedback
- The content will be used to power support
- And content that's personalized for every user.

But because of this paradigm shift, the role of technical content is changing.
It's no longer just between the editor and the reader. It will include other facets, not just humans, but the ingestion of support messages, product data, and even the codebase, that can edit the content.
But more importantly, the content will also help power other products that you've already seen with chat and AI support agents.
Today, we're the documentation platform that helps companies manage and host their technical docs.
But, we will grow into this technical content layer, to help companies manage and distribute their knowledge.

At Mintlify, we create public-facing documentation for other companies.
If you're a company that needs help guides, tutorials, or API references, you can use Mintlify to write,
edit, and maintain the content, customize the look and feel, and host your docs.
We are an all-in-one platform or a one-stop-shop to fulfill all of your documentation needs.

We raised our Series A in September 2024 backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator, and Bain Capital.
We work with hundreds of paying companies such as Anthropic, Scale AI, Zapier, and many more.

We're a lean mean team of 14 people, and we're looking for more team members to join us! Apply to join [here](https://mintlify.com/careers).
